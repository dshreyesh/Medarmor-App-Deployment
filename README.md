#Response to Data Engineering Exercise

This is my response to Data Engineering coding exercise at CondÄ“ Nast.

The complete code for this exercise is hosted in the Jupyter Notebook named 'Spark Exercise.ipynb'. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the requirements, installation process of spark and database setup along with the code for each transformations as outlined in the exercise requirements. I have a few comments on the assumptions made in my understanding of the requirements for the sake of clarity. I have also included my answer to the optional bonus question at the end of the notebook to provide one-spot and easy accesss to all my resposnes within the notebook.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this message. Looking forward to the comments and discussion.

Regards,
Shreyesh
